# scala

This project contains my solution for 2 problems. I have uploaded both as individual projects so that they can be run independently. Both project contains test cases that has been written using scala-test framework. 

Best way to run the project is to import it in Intellij and let it handle all the dependencies. 

Both projects has Main.scala file which will print out expected output based on the input test given in the assignment. Extra test cases resides in src/test/scala/Test.scala
