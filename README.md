# scala

This project contains my solution for this assignment. 

I have uploaded solution to both the problems as individual projects so that they can be run independently. Both projects contain different test cases as well that has been written using scala-test framework. 

Best way to run these projects is to import each independently in Intellij and let it handle all the dependencies. 

Both projects has Main.scala file which, when executed, will print out expected output based on the given test data. 
Extra test cases resides in src/test/scala/Test.scala
